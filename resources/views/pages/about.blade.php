            <div style="max-width:80%;margin-left:10%;padding:10px;"><h4 style="text-align:center;">What does our site do?</h4>
            <p>With our site a user will be able to add a series of domains to a list that our site will check on and
                report the status change to that user. This allows for users to be able to get notified when a domain
                changes in its status without having to constantly check themselves.
                Looking forward our team is intending to build a system that will allow users to set an amount they
                would like to bid for a domain, so that if a domain comes up for auction we can then submit a bid up to
                their max amount on their behalf. This feature will include a manual and automatic mode.
